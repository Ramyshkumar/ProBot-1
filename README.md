# ProBot-2

# FYP Spring 2019:

A chat bot that is intended to be accessed for consultation over various topics and queries. 
The queries may relate to Computer Sciences, Law, Health, Medicine, etc. 
The idea is to make a bot that will learn through conversations with experts of various fields, so it can answer the respective questions asked by users.

For instance, a user may consult bot regarding the legal assistance over a property dispute.
Upon such query, the bot could assist the client based on the learned conversations with legal advisors and people related to the field. 
In case the query asked by the user is unknown to the bot, the bot will then prompt the available experts and people related to the field about the new query. 
Upon such situation, the user will be notified by the bot via instant messaging or emailing services.
